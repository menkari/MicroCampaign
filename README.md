# [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com) with a couple of extras..

## This is not the official HTML5 boilerplate, if you're looking for that head on over here: [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com)

HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building
fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites. I've added in a few bits
and pieces to allow things like social login (FB for now), AWS Cognito
and DynamoDb.

This project is really a starting point for anyone wanting to create a microsite,
marketing campaign site or anything similar. Most small websites require some
form of data capture, but traditionally this meant some form of intermediary like
an API or third party services in order to keep data or access secure. The whole
point is to provide rich functionality and keep the **COSTS LOW**

Seriously, you could run a single page application like using Angular or React,
store the codebase in AWS S3, Azure Blob or Google Cloud Platform Bucket and have
data persisted like a normal database and run it for less than $5 per month (YMMV).
